          <h1 class="sai">Tarantino Movies In Chronological Order</h1>
          <h1 class="movietitleone">1.Reservoir Dogs(1992)</h1>
          <img src="./pictures/reservoir dogs.jpg" class="reservoirdogs">
          
          <p class="reservoirdogswriting">
            It’s tempting to call Reservoir Dogs the ultimate independent film: it’s a heist movie, only due to budgetary concerns, we never actually see the heist, mostly just the aftermath. The film is actually stronger for that. It’s all about the process, not the payoff. The process is the payoff.<br><br>Still, as crackling and head-turning as the filmmaking is, this caper doesn’t transcend its genre-movie trappings to become something more the way Tarantino’s best have. Watching Reservoir Dogs in 2019, it feels like a wildly talented young filmmaker warming up for bigger and better things.<br><br><em>The best part:</em> The climactic Mexican standoff is a mini-masterpiece of character-driven suspense.
          </p>
          
          <h1 class="movietitletwo">2.Pulp Fiction(1994)</h1>
          <img src="./pictures/pulp fiction.jpg" class="pulpfiction">

          <p class="pulpfictionwriting">
            Pulp Fiction tells a pretty standard, run-of-the-mill crime story about a crime boss, his wife, and some hired guns. It’s the telling of it all that makes this one of the essential films of 1990s, one of the ultimate movie experiences to get lost in.<br><br>
            Pulp Fiction is told in extravagantly nonlinear fashion, but it’s hard to feel too disoriented when mostly we’re just thrilled by the hilarity and excitement of what’s playing out in front of us moment-to-moment. Tarantino’s trademark dialogue is never about moving the plot forward; it’s about immersing us in the realities of the characters. Jackson’s Jules has the most important arc, and in a roundabout kind of way, Pulp Fiction is a movie about redemption.<br><br>
            Pulp Fiction won Cannes’s coveted Palme d’Or, and Tarantino won his first screenwriting Oscar. A star was born.

          <h1 class="movietitlethree">3.Jackie Brown(1997)</h1>
          <img src="./pictures/jackie brown.jpg" class="jackiebrown"> 

          <p class="jackiebrownwriting">
            Though some considered it a disappointment at the time of release, and it’s underrated to this day, Jackie Brown is Tarantino’s most mature, soul-satisfying storytelling. This adaptation of Elmore Leonard‘s Rum Punch doesn’t sacrifice the invention, hilarity, danger, or intoxicating theatricalities of Pulp Fiction, but the characters are perhaps even richer, and it’s got even more heart. In fact, Jackie Brown has something that’s eluded every other film in the Tarantino canon: a great romance.<br><br>
            Robert Forster was Oscar-nominated for his turn as a world-weary bail bondsman who becomes hopelessly smitten with a beautiful flight attendant (a great performance by Pam Grier) in the midst of a heist.<br><br>
            Jackie Brown lightly homages Blaxploitation pictures of the 1970s (of which Grier was queen), and as is the case in all of Tarantino’s films, sharply selected music selections do some of the storytelling. Jackie Brown benefits greatly from a Delfonics motif, and rousing bookends of “Across 110th Street” by Bobby Womack.

          <h1 class="movietitlefour">4.Kill Bill: Volume1(2003) and Volume2(2004)</h1>
          <img src="./pictures/kill bill.jpg" class="killbill">

          <p class="killbillwriting">
            Released theatrically in two volumes, Kill Bill is best enjoyed as The Whole Bloody Affair (which is long overdue on Blu-Ray). More than a mere cut and paste, the supercut makes a few key changes (like removing the cliffhanger from part one) that up the drama considerably. That makes the stunningly choreographed—sometimes phantasmagorically gory—action matter that much more.<br><br>
            A lot of the credit for this top-shelf action picture goes to Tarantino’s longtime editor Sally Menke, who tragically passed away in 2010. She was a modern master in her field.<br><br>
            The best part: Uma Thurman‘s towering, comical, full-bodied, maternal tour-de-force as the justice-seeking Bride deserved Oscar attention. The movie is a (admittedly, brilliantly constructed and relentlessly entertaining) revenge fantasy; Thurman gives it a soul. The late David Carradine is magnificent, too.

          <h1 class="movietitlefive">5.Death Proof(2009)</h1>
          <img src="./pictures/death proof.jpg" class="deathproof">

          <p class="deathproofwriting">
            Riding respective hits Kill Bill and Sin City, Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez joined forces for a wide-released double bill called Grindhouse, a grungy homage to ’70s B-movies. Most people who buy multiplex tickets don’t geek out over things like film grain and “cigarette burns,” though, and Grindhouse flopped at the box office.<br><br>
            Tarantino’s half, starring Kurt Russell as a stuntman lunatic who seeks to murder women with his car, was definitely better than Rodriguez’s campy, unpleasant Planet Terror— but it’s overindulgent and tedious.<br><br>
            The action is phenomenally great, but we have to sit through an hour-plus of dialogue that’s never particularly interesting to get there. A subplot featuring Mary Elizabeth Winstead‘s Lee, an adult film star, is either funny, disturbing, or tasteless–or it might be a bit of each.<br><br>
            Death Proof ends with one of the most breathless, exhilarating car chases ever captured on-camera. It’s the kind of thing that could have a measurable impact on your blood pressure and heart rate. It’s funny, too.

           <h1 class="movietitlesix">6.Inglourious Basterds(2009)</h1>
           <img src="./pictures/inglourius basterds.jpg" class="basterds">

           <p class="basterdswriting">
            This World War II-era thriller is Tarantino the filmmaker at his most confident: revisionist history that’s at once high art, and more popcorn-munchingly entertaining than anything playing at the multiplex.<br><br>
            The final moments rewrite history in a symphony of blood, guts and flames, to jaw-dropping effect. It is probably the most exciting thing Tarantino has ever filmed. The spirit of Inglorious isn’t far removed from that of Django Unchained, but this is a far more thoughtful, clever and dramatically weighty picture.<br><br>
            Christoph Waltz did a clean sweep of awards season for his chilling portrayal of Nazi colonel Hans Landa.<br><br>
           </p>
           
           <h1 class="movietitleseven">7.Django Unchained(2012)</h1>
           <img src="./pictures/django unchained.jpg!d" class="django">

           <p class="djangowriting">
            Django Unchained has a compelling plot idea (a freed slave sets out to free his enslaved wife), characteristically meaty Tarantino dialogue, and no shortage of fine performances.<br><br>Applying the episodic format and visual template of classic and spaghetti Westerns to a revenge saga mostly set in the Deep South just before the Civil War, the film makes a point of pushing the savagery of slavery to the forefront but does so in a way that rather amazingly dovetails with the heightened historical, stylistic and comic sensibilities at play. The anecdotal, odyssey-like structure of this long, talky saga could be considered indulgent, but Tarantino injects the weighty material with so many jocular, startling and unexpected touches that it’s constantly stimulating.<br><br>
            Django Unchained is Tarantino’s highest-grossing film ever, earning over $425 million worldwide. It was nominated for five Oscars and won two: Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Christoph Waltz).

           <h1 class="movietitleeight">8.The Hateful Eight(2015)</h1>
           <img src="./pictures/hateful eight.jpg.crdownload" class="hatefuleight">

           <p class="hatefuleightwriting">
            Set in the post-Civil War era, the movie pits a group of criminals and criminally brutal lawmen against each other in a snowbound Wyoming cabin. Tarantino takes his sweet time assembling his core cast.<br><br>
            The Hateful Eight is an indulgence. But few do indulgence better than Quentin Tarantino. Here the film, unfurled as “chapters”, feels like an actual short story for a cold winter day. Each time someone enters a room from a blizzard, you can imagine reading the anxious occupants shout those instructions out to “nail the broken door shut”. They speak together and over each other, like people one has known before thrown together by circumstances.<br><br>
            The director even chooses 70 mm film format and then decides to go entirely indoors, locking the characters together in a haberdashery that becomes almost as familiar as the rest of the characters by the time The Hateful Eight gets around to its ending. 
           </p>

           <h1 class="movietitlenine">9.Once Upon A Time In Hollywood(2019)</h1>
           <img src="./pictures/once upon a time in hollywood.jpg" class="hollywood">

           <p class="hollywoodwriting">
            In his surprisingly crowd-pleasing ninth feature, his most personal movie to date, Tarantino eulogizes a bygone era. The 165-minute runtime might sound excessive, but there are boundless pleasures to be found here. Among them, the late Luke Perry shares a scene with DiCaprio that’s one of the movie’s best.<br><br>
            It’s the two lead performances. DiCaprio is achingly, screen-commandingly great as Rick Dalton, a fading TV star riddled with insecurities. Pitt plays his second-banana stunt double, ironically with the kind of presence basically no one out there can rival. Their bromance has a sweetness to it that audiences will love.<br><br>
            The movie draws a very clear line regarding the end of that classic age: it’s set in 1969, at a time when the studios were in financial crisis owing to their trouble keeping up with changing times, and its plot involves the event that’s widely cited as the end of an era, the Manson Family killings of Sharon Tate and four others at the house that she shared with her husband, Roman Polanski. The heroism of his Hollywood characters is an idea that Tarantino works out gradually until it bursts forth, in a final-act twist, with a shocking clarity.

           <h1 class="question">Will There Be Another Tarantino movie?</h1>
           <p class="par">
               He started his career with the plan of doing 10 films exactly, and now that he has completed 9 films, his next film might be his last film. There are rumours that it might be a horror film. He also stated that he is interested in making Kill Bill 3, but even if he does, technically the count wouldn't be ten. However he said he is firm and confirms his plans to retire after his 10th film. He also said in a press interview that he wants to quit when he is at the top of his game. The filmmaker said he has had a really long career. "I don't have a reason that I would want to say out loud that's going to<span class="inter">win any argument in the court of public opinion or supreme court or anything like that. At the same time, working for 30 years doing as many movies as I've done is not as many as other people but that's a long career. That's a really long career. And I've given it everything I have," Quentin added.</span>
