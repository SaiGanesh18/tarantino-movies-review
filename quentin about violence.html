            Okay so if you're new or don't know much about Tarantino you might be thinking who's this maniac? why is he normalising violence? etc etc.. Known for his ultra-cool and stylishly violent flicks like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Tarantino has won a lot of fans for his unique vision but he has also attracted the attention of hyper-conservative critics. Some people say his movies are very violent and there's too much bloodshed and it doesn’t cater to family audience and children. "Let them watch my movies once they become adults, there's no hurry" said the Filmmaker once in an interview. These criticisms multiplied in subsequent years, especially when he came out with Kill Bill. During one particular interview, the interviewer asked Tarantino whether this film was appropriate for children. The director said: “It’s an R-rated movie. If their parents take them to go see it, they will have a blast. I actually think, from 12 up, is a really good audience; they will love Kill Bill. Girls will love it because they will be empowered.”<br>However, the interviewer kept asking annoyingly moralising questions about the use of violence in Tarantino’s films. She pushed too far when she repeatedly asked Tarantino why he likes cinematic violence, to which he replied: “BECAUSE IT’S SO MUCH FUN, JAN!… You know what, Jan? I don’t think I made it for you.”

            Revenge is the main theme of most Tarantino movies and with it, violence comes as a package. Bloodied hands, over-exaggerated display of uncensored violence and death form the crux of his films. Violence in Tarantino’s movies are placed in unexpected moments, with scenes of three or more characters pointing guns at each other, supported by an intense scene to set the mood for a gory suspense.<br> <br> 
            Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino said that violence is one of the most fun things to watch and surely he’s applied this thought in all his creations in the best possible way. Over the years, the winner of two Academy awards has turned the portrayal of violence in modern cinema by making gore fun to watch. You know you are experiencing a roller-coaster of emotions in a Tarantino movie when swords, bloodshed and high-intensity action scenes start to tickle your senses. Tarantino already mentioning that violence is one of the most fun things to watch, it’s evident that he has to power to aestheticize violence even for the non-violent impressed audience.
